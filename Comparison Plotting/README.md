Randomize the dataset
Create 10 equal partion and use it for 10 fold cross validation
use decision tree classifier with max depth b/w 2 to 8 and 10 fold cross variation
plot the max depth vs avrage error with standard deviation as error bar 
use KNN classifier with K=3,15 and 10 fold cross variation
Plot K vs Average error with standard deviation as error bar
